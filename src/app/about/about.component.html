<h5 style="font-weight: bold">Why aren't my Twitch videos showing up?</h5>
<p>It's possible you have not yet linked your Twitch account to your Bungie account. If you don't know how to link your accounts, check out <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/45202" target="_blank">this Bungie Help Article</a>.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold">Why is the site so slow right now?</h5>
<p>It could be the Bungie API, Twitch API, or Xbox API slowing things down. But it's probably Xbox. The Xbox API takes nearly a full second to respond to each request on a good day.</p>
