<h3>About</h3>
<p>Guardian Theater is a mash up of the Bungie, Twitch, and Xbox APIs.</p>
<p>Searching for a Guardian retrieves a list of recent activities that Guardian has participated in. Then for each activity, the site seeks out to display all gameplay clips recorded by any of the participating Guardians which overlap with the timespan in which the activity took place.</p>
<p>Guardian Theater was created by <a (click)="route(['/guardian/chrisfried'])">Chris Fried</a> with invaluable assistance from <a (click)="route(['/guardian/RealAngryMonkey'])">Dustin Rue</a>.</p>

<h5 style="font-weight: bold">Why is the site so slow right now?</h5>
<p>It could be Bungie, Twitch, or Xbox slowing things down. But it's probably Xbox. The chart below displays Xbox response time over the past 24 hours.</p>
